    <h1>summary</h1>
</center>
<p>Hi! I'm Juan. I was born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay. 
    I've been dedicating my life working with various forms of art such as live visuals and music production which are the ones i find a special connection to.
    I did 5 records of my own and i worked on over a dozen including collabs playing, recording or mixing.
    Since 2014 i worked closely with the electronic music scene as VJ (visual jockey)
</p>
    <p>I went to college for a degree in international relations. It's one of those things that i find passion to just know and collect some tools to analize reality.
        I plan to keep on studying and developing my interests.
    </p>
